            <p> Ice cream and related products can be divided into a number of categories. As legislation varies from one country to another, the following should be regarded as a guideline only.
                The fat content of ice cream typically determines the category to which it belongs. In some countries fat content has to exceed 9% to "qualify” for the ice cream category. Below this level, the product is typically called milk ice, whereas ice cream with more than 12 to 13% fat is often categorized as either luxury or premium.</p>

        <p> Now, let us read BYJU’S essay on ice cream in English to learn about the ice cream’s history and origin. The history of ice cream is long and exciting. It has been debated between countries and cultures. The history of ice cream spans thousands of years, going back to the ancient Mongol empire and later to China. Ancient civilisations would mix ingredients to make ice cream. Parachuting green tea extracts into iced milk to cool the drink and prevent it from spoiling allowed for its widespread use across Asia. For centuries, people in China used ice cream for more than just as healthy food; its cooling properties were considered medicinal. It was introduced to Europe by Marco Polo, who called it ‘gelato.’ However, Europeans quickly changed this name and adopted the term ‘ice’ for the dessert. By the 17th century, ice cream was popularised in England, with the first recorded mention of ‘cream’, adding milk and frozen ice together.

            Ice cream has been around for centuries and continues to become more popular. Though children love ice creams the most, it is consumed by people of every age and in almost every country. Ice cream is necessary for many households and is often used on special occasions. For similar essays and other kids learning activities, visit BYJU’S website.</p>
